First I figured out how to use the decode, encrypt, encode functions.
Once convinced I was translating properly, I made a for-loop range(0x100)
(printing a divider and the key used for each translation)
printed out each of the 256 possible translations.
scrolled my happy self thru the list untill I saw some english.
noted the key.
re-tested with a specific use of that key, instead of a general loop
called it a day.
