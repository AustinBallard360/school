I already submitted the assignment and got 100. But during debugging I was dying to try out this idea to get some feedback on the online submission test cases.
I wanted to just stdout the input and use one submission to get more info on the test inputs.
But you posted in piazza that the stdout was not actually reported, due to the ease of getting the test cases. 
This made me wonder if stderr was also not reported.
From the other classmates on piazza, it seems like they are getting things back on stderr.

So I am gonna pipe the input into stderr and see if I can get your test cases.
I have already done the assignment, and I wont share them with anyone else.
I feel like this is very much in the spirit of the course, and done in good conscience.
